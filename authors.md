**Melissa Terry**

Melissa is a lecturer in the College of Fine Arts at the University of Texas – Rio Grande Valley and is finishing her PhD in the department of Art History at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Her research interests are rooted in contemporary non-traditional art forms. She explores the visual politics and spatialities of socially engaged art and is interested in the ways in which capitalism, globalization, and neoliberal paradigms inform visual culture. Within this frame, she studies the aesthetics of handmade material objects, including the signs created by homeless folks and social movement activists, as they function in real and digital spaces.
