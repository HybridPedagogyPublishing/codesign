<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Exploring the dynamically discursive nature of syllabi as boundary objects — the complex, often surprisingly fraught negotiations involved when one new element is introduced to traditional syllabi: the charge to bring in a collaborator from outside one's home discipline.</p>

    Abstract: Within the discipline of art history, the gallery space has been referred to as a white cube, a space detached from everyday experience. In line with a long history of institutional critiques of this mode of exhibition my collaborators and I similarly find the white cube to be hollow, especially in its pedagogical offerings. This essay outlines a collaborative venture to create a pedagogical model for youth around street art in Milwaukee, WI. By drawing from our individual experiences in the study of art and urban history, activism, and public art, we focus on the history of art made and displayed outside the white cube. The essay recalls a history of community art in the inner city and critiques certain projects as Great Society initiatives that manipulated and suppressed black activism, especially after a string of race riots in the sixties and seventies. We use this history as a pedagogical tool to critique our own project as it develops. The syllabus for our course highlights local urban history and the history of policing, as well as urban development and decay while requiring students to physically create street art in a variety of media. We also address a recent trend in the ‘art world’ towards positioning street art as high art. By linking the course to the established local art community, we hope to revive important questions about art, space, surveillance, and the contemporary cityscape in Milwaukee, especially as the city’s art scene is increasingly fashioned as progressive and innovative.
