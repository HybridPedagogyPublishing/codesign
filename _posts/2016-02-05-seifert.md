title:  "Opening the <i>White Cube</i> and Finding it Empty: Codesigning a Pedagogy for Art In the Streets"
author: Melissa Terry

> The term black box in both technical and social science parlance is a device or system that, for convenience, is described solely in terms of its inputs and outputs. One need not understand anything about what goes on inside such black boxes. One simply brackets them as instruments that perform certain valuable functions.[^1]

In his 1993 essay, Langdon Winner writes that while social constructivists have “opened the black box and shown a colorful array of social actors, processes, and images therein, the box they reveal is still a remarkably hollow one.”[^2] Within the discipline of art history, the gallery space has been referred to as a white cube, a space increasingly detached from everyday experience. Critiquing museums in his 1976 essay, Brian O’Doherty describes the white cube:

> The outside world must not come in, so windows are usually sealed off. Walls are painted white. The ceiling becomes the source of light. The wooden floor is polished so that you click along clinically, or carpeted so that you pad soundlessly, resting the feet while the eyes have at the wall. The art is free, as the saying used to go, “to take on its own life.”[^3]

Institutional critiques of this particularly modernist and often exclusionary mode of exhibition are prevalent within art theory and practice. Like Langdon opening the black box of science, art theorists have long worked to open the white cube of art history to reveal its inner workings. Rosalind Krauss’ 1990 essay “The Cultural Logic of the Late Capitalist Museum”[^4] and Carol Duncan’s 1995 *Civilizing Rituals: Inside Public Art Museums* speak to the expanding field of museum criticism.[^5] Artists such as Michael Asher, Andrea Fraser, and Fred Wilson, among others, have lead the way in criticizing the boundaries of the white cube.[^6] Similarly, my collaborators and I find the white cube to be remarkably hollow, especially in what it offers in terms of pedagogy. In crafting this collaborative syllabus, we opted to focus on the history of art making created and displayed outside the white cube. But this history includes state and corporate led urban renewal and beautification projects often labeled as community public arts, and sometimes leading to gentrification in under-privileged neighborhoods. A range of art world developments in recent years, including relational aesthetics[^7], site-specific art[^8], new genre public art[^9], and project work[^10] have contributed to a blurring of white cube aesthetics and what constitutes the inside and outside. For this reason, it is important that we think of our local community similarly as co-designers and collaborators. Past projects produced for and on behalf of certain communities, often imposing outside values on those communities, have proven harmful and fostered public skepticism of urban art ventures.

This history is particularly rich in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where my collaborators and I are co-designing a summer course geared towards the city’s youth and centered on the history and practice of art-making in public space. The course includes an awareness and understanding of the history and implications of past community arts programs that have been introduced into Milwaukee’s north side to manipulate and suppress black activism. Art was (and is) often advertised as a community unifier used, as critics of such programs in Milwaukee have pointed out, to pacify populations, keeping youth busy and out of the streets. With this history (and present) in mind, my collaborators and I seek to alter what community arts means for today. A few contemporary projects include Typeface (a public art project focusing its effort in four inter-city neighborhoods)[^11] and Arts on Fond du Lac (a temporary art project along Milwaukee’s Fond du Lac avenue on which my collaborator, Chelsea Wait, was the lead artist). But while these projects have been praised is media and art circles, they too lack an emphasis on community engagement. To address this, our course will include weekly conversations with local residents which will inform the syllabus as we work through the material, incorporating responses from the community. Forms of media which are often seen as taboo in the discipline of art history ― like aerosol, wheatpaste, posters, stickers, and yarn ― will be emphasized as valuable and historically rooted media making up the core curricula of the course.

I am currently working on my PhD in the department of Art History at the University of Illinois where I study the aesthetics of hand-inscription and social justice in public space. My two collaborators include Dr. Joe Austin, history professor at UW–Milwaukee and author of *Taking the Train: How Graffiti Art Became an Urban Crisis in New York City*[^12], and Chelsea Wait, street artist and graduate student in Architecture and Urban Planning at UW–Milwaukee.

Writing about pedagogy and power, Henry Giroux poses an important question: “Whose history, story, and experience prevails in the school setting?”[^13] In terms of studio and art history classes offered for young people, the answer to this question is undoubtedly limited. Conventional art history textbooks and curriculum present a view based predominantly on the story and experience of white men who still dominate the Canon. Young people are not often encouraged to explore media outside the usual suspects including painting, drawing, ceramics, and sometimes craft. This curriculum is often reinforced within the white cube of the museum space, a non-neutral space rendering invisible the social life and contextual politics of objects as to simulate self-containment and neutrality.

Our class is increasingly vital within the current art climate of Milwaukee as the city has been recently praised as a space of cultural revival and a growing destination for young “up-and-coming” creative professionals and green entrepreneurs.[^14] It is geared towards Milwaukee’s city youth with aims to teach to their experience, drawing from the types of art they see daily. Classically dominant art techniques like drawing and painting will be used in a broader sense as students prepare sketches for street art in a variety of often overlooked media. The class will focus on both the art historical aspects of street art as well as the artistic processes of making various forms of art in the streets. Giroux’s, “Literacy, Pedagogy, and the Politics of Difference” and Langdon Winner's “Do Artifacts Have Politics?” will function as frameworks through which to think about what it means to offer a class like ours which seeks to learn from the challenges and failures of earlier projects. In some ways, our course risks resembling earlier ventures in city beautification following a series of ‘race riots’ taking place predominantly in the late sixties and early seventies in Milwaukee. We seek to recognize this history and use it as a pedagogical tool to critique our own project as it develops. This ever-present past is important to our work and necessitates a brief overview before delving into the ways in which we plan to engage with and critique Milwaukee’s history of community arts programs as we cultivate our own.

## Historicizing Community Art in Milwaukee

On July 30, 1967, civil disobedience broke out in Milwaukee’s north side, a predominantly black neighborhood. In the name of black power and housing reform, rioters moved along North Third Street vandalizing storefronts of “non-soul brother owned stores.”[^15] By the early morning of July 31, several homes, businesses, and cars were destroyed. Mayor Henry Maier instituted a mandatory curfew while more than 1,000 national guardsmen where called in to patrol the area.[^16] A few days later, on August 2, unarmed eighteen-year-old youth worker and college sophomore Clifford McKissick was shot and killed by a policeman in the doorway of his home (although police suggest he was shot while fleeing a firebombing).[^17] The officer who shot McKissick was not indicted ― the incident closely parallels the countless contemporary unjustified murders of young black men by police, reminding us of an ever-present flow between past and present. Following these events, a series of riots arose throughout the month of August. The summer of 1967 left Milwaukee’s north side with burnt-out houses, empty property lots, and abandoned businesses. In cities across the country, including Detroit, New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles, black communities rose up responding to various local and national issues.[^18]

Around this time, the Johnson administration’s vision of the Great Society sought to address racial unrest in America. The initiative materialized in a variety of community action programs as part of a nationwide War on Poverty. The program’s objective was “to get action initiated against poverty at the point closest to where the people live by encouraging and inspiring local governmental units, and local private voluntary agencies, to initiate programs at the local level.”[^19] Written into a community action act in 1964, Johnson stated, “The Great Society…demand\[ed\] an end to poverty and racial injustice,” offering “a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talent.”[^20]

As part of the project, Job Corps and Neighborhood Youth Corps were initiated within black communities to control young people and prevent riots.[^21] These programs have been heavily critiqued by many theorists, including Francis Fox Piven and Richard Cloward, for managing community relations in ways that sought to depoliticize and govern youth in the city.[^22] Reporting about the 1967 events, the city’s black newspaper, *Milwaukee Star*, stated “most of the rioters who caused the disturbance were young teenagers expressing themselves in a tone of ‘Now they’re listening to us’…”[^23] Since urban youth were seen as comprising the core of rioters, many community investment programs were geared at this population.

Just a year later, in 1968 Mayor Maier revealed that the city would received \$25,000 through federal grants and the National Endowment of the Arts to develop cultural arts programs in the inner city.[^24] The *Milwaukee Star* announced that \$7,500 would be used to open “The Paint Box,” a community art school, while \$2,000 would support a community youth center “to help its participating youth \[with\] arts, crafts, music, visual arts, dance and dramatics.”[^25] Community programs to beautify Milwaukee’s north side were enacted in a variety of ways. One such project, the planting of a tree “whose roots could spread throughout the United States,” called for “the removal of all accumulated litter, the construction a field stone sidewalk, the planting of sod and the painting of the side of a building on the site where later a mural \[would\] be completed.”[^26] Funded by the Miller Brewing Company, the ‘tree-planting project’ was just one of many ventures aimed at beautifying the city through corporate and state funded community investment programs. Many programs, even the tree project with environmental aims, utilized art as a technology of governance, to save and settle unrest in the city.[^27]

Another remnant of the War on Poverty mindset was the Milwaukee Murals program. Sponsored by the Milwaukee Youth Foundation, the murals program actively sought spaces to ‘transform’. Director of the program, Marie Burton suggested, “painting a mural can not only bring awareness of self, but is a good outlet for suppressed tensions too,” adding “Painting murals is really a kind of artistic graffiti.”[^28] Many community investment programs, like these, relied on the arts to enter and beautify black communities. The Ford Foundation sold such programs as supportive of black power initiatives while in most cases black activism was bought off. Projects were often funded from the outside (including monies from the National Endowment for the Arts and Keep America Beautiful) but managed and led by local community members under federal requirements that the poor participate.[^29] Some spaces, like The Creative Center (an art center made possible by the state funded Inner City Arts Council), were even required to pay local youth to participate in certain activities.[^30] Because of this, programs were often accepted and praised as well intentioned within communities. The language of transformation contributes to this positive image of such programs. But the use of such language can also suggest a predominant interest in aesthetic changes in communities (often leading to beautification and gentrification) rather than structural changes which might actually empower residents and strengthen neighborhoods.

It is important here to acknowledge that in the press record there is a general absence in the documentation of community opinions ― positive or critical ― about the aforementioned projects. This failure to capture such voices suggests a disinterest the communities most affected by these projects and makes scholarship on the subject difficult. I have suggested that Great Society art-based programs treated these inter-city communities as spaces to be controlled, drawing funding from the outside to quiet the inside. This sentiment is mirrored in a quote by Kenneth Addison, the director of The Soul Shack (a teen center ― one of five programs initiated by the Inter City Arts Council). Referring to the necessity of The Soul Shack and other programs, he states that these “should be developed with a programmatical goal ― not just designed to “keep cool for summer.”[^31] Addison’s reference to “keep\[ing\] cool for summer” directly acknowledges an understanding among community members that certain programs within the community were initiated simply to pacify city youth during hot summers. However, the fact that evidence of such criticism in the mainstream press is largely absent from archival records suggests a general disinterest in community responses to these initiatives.[^32]

Art was (and is) often advertised as a community unifier used (as the aforementioned sources suggest) to keep youth busy and out of the streets. It is essential that my collaborators and I acknowledge this expansive history wherein arts programs are used to manipulate and suppress black activism. We would like to engage with this history to attempt to alter the meaning of urban community arts today.

## Pedagogy Outside the White Cube

Important questions that emerged from our collaboration include: How does art enter into spaces of contestation, abandonment, and disenfranchisement and for what purpose? What does our project seek to do, and might we seek to build collaborations in these spaces where past collaborations were problematically developed in earlier programs that still mark the memory and physical space of local communities? The projects outlined in the above paragraphs utilized murals and other legalized forms of public art. Our project seeks to valorize other public art forms like graffiti, wheatpasting, postering, stickering, and yarn bombing as critical topics in studio art education. These forms of public media are often still seen as taboo within the discipline of art history; the white cube, the gallery space, values and reinforces art pedagogies rooted in canonical art history. Subjects like painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, and photography continue to make up the majority of art curriculum for young people. Instead, we seek to design a method of teaching art that trains youth to value and create nontraditional media outside the gallery. The writings of Giroux and Winner again serve to frame the politics of our class in relation to those earlier projects outlined above.

In his essay, Winner writes about the need to look behind technical devices to see the social circumstances of their development, deployment, and use.  The author points to two ways in which artifacts have political properties; first, through their use of invention, design, and arrangement to address an issue in a community and second, through man-made systems which require a political relationship, making technologies “inherently political”.[^33] Winner’s theories can be applied to the ways in which the term ‘art’ (as a general notion) can have varying politics. For instance, the public art (community art, beautification works, murals) used by the state and corporations in the late sixties and early seventies in Milwaukee to pacify residents have a different politics than contemporary graffiti art. Perhaps both of these types of art have politics entirely different from the (fine?) art within the walls of the Milwaukee Art Museum. Since our class will meet for part of each week literally within the Milwaukee Art Museum, a “white cube” of the ‘art world’, there will be a constant dialogue between ‘insider’ and ‘outsider’ cultures, between high and low art worlds.[^34]

One way that our course will address these issues is by starting the class with lectures and field trips centered around the subject of abandonment in city spaces. Readings will include Henri Lefebvre, “The Right to the City” as well as John Schneider’s somewhat dated chapter “The Professional Police and the City.”[^35] These works, along with a group tour around the city will facilitate a conversation with students about familiar spaces and how they might see abandonment locally. Most importantly, it will allow them to think about how abandonment (as intimately connected to policing) establishes a particular view of certain neighborhoods as tied to criminality and fear.

Giroux’s writings are again important to cite. He calls for all cultural workers to recognize and teach specifically about all forms of oppression both inside and outside individual experiences. He suggests that educators must speak, write, and listen in a language of difference.[^36] He calls for a literacy of difference that might “enhance the possibility of dialogue, trust, and solidarity.”[^37] The author proposes a postmodern/postcolonial discourse to provide “counter-discursive strategies that open up new spaces for oppositional languages and practices.”[^38]

Giroux’s work is especially useful in regards to our syllabus as we struggle to make visible the power relations, privilege, and authority inherent in our specific positions as teachers, as educated adults and scholars, and as white folks. To move away from the student/teacher dichotomy, class will frequently take place outside the classroom, in more neutral spaces, students will be asked to lead class, and group work will be encouraged. To further dissolve these power relations, my collaborator and I will engage in weekly conversations with our students as well as community residents about the public art projects we plan to materialize. These are topics ― power and the politics of collaboration ― that we hope to grapple with throughout the class as we discuss with students the ways in which history is written and produced. For instance, how does our syllabus, as a product of our collaboration and our shared political leanings reflect how we hope to (re)position the history and making of street art and graffiti? How do we balance the radicalism that seems to be an unspoken assumption inherent in our collaborative efforts and the “positive message” that will be required for any realistic chance of receiving funding? In what ways might a class on this topic look the same or different if taught by a conservative art historian (who may hold the belief that graffiti is vandalism)? These are important questions that Giroux’s work will lead us to address.

## Two Visions of Milwaukee

In recent years, news websites and publications have touted Milwaukee as an increasingly popular destination for green entrepreneurs, young professionals and creatives, and tourists, as fun, exciting, and “up-and-coming.” For instance, in August 2014 *Salon* magazine wrote of Milwaukee as “the new Portland”, focusing on the city’s ecologically innovative buildings and urban planning.[^39] In these celebratory accounts, Milwaukee successfully overcomes its “rust belt” status, transcending the combined forces of industrial decline, inner-city poverty, failed public schools, and a deteriorating built environment, which permeate notions of ‘urban crisis’. Missing from this interpretation is Milwaukee’s chronically hyper-segregated racial and economic landscape,[^40] the city’s alarming rates of black-male unemployment and incarceration, and its role in advancing a neoliberal policy agenda that has encouraged the privatization of a range of public services and imposed market-oriented rationalities on all levels of government.

The juxtaposition of these two visions of Milwaukee reveals a central tension inherent to notions of urban progress. The complex array of agencies, institutions, and powerbrokers instrumental to shaping “Start-up Milwaukee” in the Neoliberal Age have consistently and perpetually advanced their own interests at the expense of fostering a truly equal, democratic, and just city. This vision of the city relies on the commodification of particular resources and culture, the enclosure of public land and infrastructure, and the enhancement of social control mechanisms to succeed. But what does this fashioning of the segregated city as innovative and up-and-coming actually say about the local political and race-based issues which permeate city spaces? And how does art enter into this debate and where do we fit in?

The face of the city’s contemporary art scene, the Milwaukee Art Museum, underwent a major renovation in 2001 as world-renowned Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava designed the buildings new central entrance space, the Quadracci Pavilion. The building, forever altering the Milwaukee skyline from the waters of Lake Michigan, is now a symbol of artistic as well as economic and social progress in the city. (Figure 1) The art scene’s 2001 facelift along with the rise of the creative class (including artists and academics like us) certainly contributes to go-global, neoliberal agendas and is often touted as vital to the transformation of the city. Such dramatic cultural and economic transitions, that have been both celebrated by many official public channels and that have sparked local debates and conflicts in others, invite new pedagogical interventions. Our position as young professionals, or what some urban development theorists have named contemporary “creative classes,”[^41] gives us power but also drives us to resist assumptions that we work in the name of gentrification and ‘progress’.

It is also important to address a recent trend in the ‘art world’ towards positioning graffiti and street art as high art and culture. Readings focusing on this subject will be assigned near the end of the course; students will read an article by instructor Joe Austin while also looking at a recent exhibition, *Art in the Streets,* at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.[^42] As teachers, we must navigate this subject carefully so that students may recognize the power relation in place which allow graffiti to be illegal and criminalized in public space but praised and canonized in (often private) galleries and museums.[^43] This essay has consisted of a series of questions, rather than answers, which focus on the complexities of offering a course about graffiti and street art in a city like Milwaukee while aiming to please students, local residents, urban planners, and state funders.

Because of Milwaukee’s history of community action programs (which often sought to use art as a way to ‘heal’ the city and keep its citizens busy) as well as its contemporary positioning as an innovative and progressive cityscape, it is essential that we utilize both contexts (past and present) as pedagogical tools. We aim to recognize examples of exploitative community arts programs from the sixties and seventies (and since then) as projects that exist under similar yet different guises today as the city continues to beautify disenfranchised urban spaces in the name of healing, transformation, and progress.

An important task will be recognizing these programs historically and presently to allow self-criticism of our art projects as we seek to displace those problematic beautification projects with ones that strengthen communities. One of our main goals for the course is to empower local youth through the practice of art in public space and to teach subjects otherwise deemed taboo in the classroom.  Another major objective is to involve community members as collaborators. For instance, locals will be asked for feedback regarding the class before, during, and after its development. Joe, Chelsea, and I, as well as the students involved, will conduct weekly interviews with people in the neighborhoods in which we seek to make an intervention. The syllabus is flexible and malleable and allows for the incorporation of feedback as the Summer session progresses. The class will also foster safe art practices in the city and promote the de-criminalization of graffiti and street artists.  By linking the course with the local traditional art community, we hope to revive important questions about art, space, surveillance, and the contemporary cityscape in Milwaukee, especially as the city’s art scene has been increasingly fashioned as progressive and innovative.

[^32]: This general tendency within the mainstream archival records to overlook the local reception of arts programs is frustrating and perhaps not surprising. But this absence can be just as telling as what the press chose to include. The press often highlighted the start (or funding) of such programs but then neglected to follow-up with community members which implies an interest in advertising government and state support of programs while ignoring the physical workings, stipulations, and hierarchies that come with government money. Similarly, these programs have not been visually documented in archives and for this reason, I have been unable to include visual references within this essay.
